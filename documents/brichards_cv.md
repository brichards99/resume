## Statement of Teaching Philosophy

As an educator, my reason to teach is simple: it is all about the students and helping to build their minds and see the possibilities an education can provide. I am passionate about promoting the craft and the mechanics of the IT profession. My background offers a unique combination of academic, personal, and professional experiences that not only prepares me as an instructor but ensures the opportunity to serve in the role is impactful and meaningful. I began my work as an educator as a seventh grade English teacher, a position which taught me a great deal about teaching and learning as a profession. In the twenty-four years that have passed since then, I have taught everything from writing to web design, computer security, and instructional design. No matter the topic, however, I believe the following statements to be true and they form my teaching philosophy. 

* Teaching is best delivered via a systematic process. The one I use is based on Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction and relies on setting up specific objectives for my students, teaching to those objectives, and then testing on those same ideas. I find this to not only be efficient, but also important to making sure students succeed. 
* Students are not a homogenous group, no matter what the class. It is unrealistic to expect every student to have had the same experiences. It is fair, however, for my classes to be predictable, challenging, and consistent. 
* Clear communication is the most important duty I have as an instructor. Since I teach primarily online, this is a critical factor in every course, although I have found this to be as true in face-to-face instruction as it is online. Students may not always be prepared to communicate clearly, but it is my job to set the tone and standards for communication, and to model it throughout the course. 

In the classroom, my role is to be leader who shoulders the responsibility of imparting specific knowledge and information. As the instructor, I must ensure the job is carried out in an engaging manner which also allows students the sense of freedom to contribute and ask questions. My teaching style is to come prepared and conduct the class in an orderly way that helps the students to relax and enjoy learning. I consistently encourage communication and interaction with peers, as well as myself, to engage in discussions that incorporate different points of views and beliefs. 

Students learn from each other and from the modeling of behaviors by other students and adults. No two people are the same; neither are students’ needs, and I bring that understanding into my classroom. Although students may have similarities, each relationship must fit the needs and personal challenges of the students. By developing an honest bond with students, I can encourage them to stay engaged in the class as they feel supported and motivated.  Running your class with an “open door policy” nurtures your student and the relationship will establish not only trust, but a bond between mentor and student. A teacher should be a leader who guides students to come up with their own answers to be able to consistently perform at higher levels.
